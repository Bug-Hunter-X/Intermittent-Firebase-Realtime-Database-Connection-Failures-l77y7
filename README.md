# Intermittent Firebase Realtime Database Connection Failures

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Firebase Realtime Database client fails to establish a connection, even with good network connectivity.  The failure is often silent, making debugging difficult.  This example includes a solution to implement robust error handling.

## Bug
The `bug.js` file contains code that attempts to connect to the Firebase Realtime Database.  Under certain circumstances, the connection will fail without any error messages reported to the console or the application.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling.  It includes explicit checks for connection status and appropriate feedback to the user.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
3. Install the Firebase SDK: `npm install firebase`
4. Replace `<YOUR_FIREBASE_CONFIG>` in both `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` with your actual Firebase configuration.
5. Run either `bug.js` or `bugSolution.js` and observe the results.
